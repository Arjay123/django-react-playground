    .babel-plugin-react-transform // support for react
    .babel-plugin-transform-class-properties // support for class properties in react
    .babel-preset-es2015 // support for es2015 features, preset compiles all dependencies together, rather than installing one by one
    .babel-preset-react // support for react, jsx
    .babel-preset-stage-0 // support for new features that are not yet finalized, stage 0 is the earliest stage, 3 being the last and closest to being accepted into standard


What is babel?

- transforms ES6 (new javascript) to JS
- lets devs use new ES6 features without sacrificing backwards compatibility
- support for many different build/test systems
