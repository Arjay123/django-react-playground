Notes from DjangoCon US 2016 - Django and React: Perfect Together by Jack McCloy


- django follows MVC w/o react
- in django, view is split into "views.py" and templates
    . MV->TC
    . react will replace Templates
- django with react MVRC
    . not full mvc, but not trying to be

- why use?
    . SPA
    . reusable codebase for web/ios/android w/ react native
    . manage complicated state more easily
        . good for large projects
    .React is only UI layer, doesn't matter what rest of stack
    .application state is separate from DOM
    .react controls dom change, not you


- DRF, django views will just be an API layer
