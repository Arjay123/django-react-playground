# django-react-playground
This repo is used to document my progress as I learn to hook react.js up with the django framework

# Objective
When learning react I used create-react-app to automatically generate a project for me. I realized that while I was able to learn React, I wasn't exactly sure of what Babel or Webpack did. This led to issues when trying to incorporate a Django backend into an existing React app I had written. So the purpose of this repo is to document my progress as I learn what Babel/Webpack do, how to configure them, and how to hook up react.js with Django and will hopefully serve as a reference to anyone else in a similar situation. The end result of this repo should be a small sample web application using Django, Django Rest Framework, and React.js that users can use as a reference point when creating apps with a similar stack.

Notes: I realize that with enough googling, I could probably find a repo or vm instance that has a preset sample application, but I think it's necessary to always try to understand the tech you're using.

# Start Point
I watched this talk to get a baseline idea of how Django hooks up to React and take notes on things that I need to learn further before attemping to create my own app.
